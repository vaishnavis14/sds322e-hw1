## Q1 (1 pts)

##### The dataset `quakes` contains information about earthquakes occurring near Fiji since 1964. The first few observations are listed below. 

```{R}
head(quakes)
```

##### How many observations are there of each variable (i.e., how many rows are there; show using code)? How many variables are there total (i.e., how many columns are in the dataset)? You can read more about the dataset [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/quakes.html) *Do not forget to include the code you used to find the answer each question*

```{R}
nrow(quakes)
ncol(quakes)
```

*There are 1000 rows and 5 columns in the dataset.*

---

## Q2 (2 pts)

##### What are the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values for the variables `mag` and `depth`? Note that there are many functions that can be used to answer this question. If you chose to work with each variable separately, recall that you can access individual variables in a dataframe using the `$` operator (e.g., `dataset$variable`). Describe your answer in words.

```{R}
mean(quakes$mag)
fivenum(quakes$mag)
mean(quakes$depth)
fivenum(quakes$depth)
```

*For the variable magnitude, the minimum is 4.0, the maximum is 6.4, the mean is 4.62, and the median is 4.6. For the variable depth, the minimum is 40, the maximum is 680, the mean is 311.37, and the median is 247.*

## Q3

##### Recall how logical indexing of a dataframe works in R. To refresh your memory, in the example code below I ask R for the median magnitude for quakes whose longitude is greater than 175. The two ways produce equivalent results.

```{R}
median(quakes$mag[quakes$long>175])

median(quakes[quakes$long>175,]$mag) #this is the more conventional notation
```

### 3.1 (1 pt) 
##### Explain what each of the two lines of code are doing in words. Specifically, why do we need to use the comma in the second case but not in the first? Remember that the `$` selects a single variable and that `[ ]` are used for indexing whatever object came before (either a single variable or a dataframe).

*The first line of code is picking out the magnitudes that have longitudes greater than 175 and taking the median of those magnitudes. The second line of code is picking out the rows in the dataset that have longitudes greater than 175 and taking the median of the magnitude of those quakes.*


### 3.2 (3 pts) 
##### What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's depth and its magnitude?

```{R}
mean(quakes[quakes$depth > (median(quakes$depth)), ]$mag)
mean(quakes[quakes$depth < (median(quakes$depth)), ]$mag)
```

*The mean of the variable magnitude when depth is greater than the median depth is 4.52 and the mean of the variable magnitude when depth is less than the median depth is 4.72. This suggests that the average magnitude of the earthquakes is slightly higher when the depth is less than the median depth.*

### 3.3 (2 pts) 
##### What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's latitude and it's depth?

```{R}
sd(quakes[quakes$depth > (median(quakes$depth)), ]$lat)
sd(quakes[quakes$depth < (median(quakes$depth)), ]$lat)
```

*The standard deviation of latitude when depth is greater than the median depth is 3.58 and the standard deviation of latitude when depth is less than the median depth is 6.15. This suggests that there is greater variation in latitudes in for earthquakes that happen depths greater than the median depth.*

## Q4 (2 pts)

##### The variable `depth` is measured in kilometers. Create a new variable called `depth_m` that gives depth **in meters rather than kilometers** and add it to the dataset `quakes`. To help get you started, I have given you code that creates the new variable but fills it with `NA` values. Overwrite the `NA`s below by writing code on the right-hand side of the assignment operator (`<-`) that computes the requested transformation. Print out the first few rows of the updated dataset using `head()`.

```{R}
# update the code below by replacing the NA with the correct expression to convert to meters
quakes$depth_m <- quakes$depth * 1000
head(quakes$depth_m)
```


## Q5

##### Let's make some plots in base R. 

### 5.1 (2 pt) 
##### Create a boxplot of `depth` using the `boxplot()` function. Describe where you see the min, max, and median (which you calculated in question 2) in this plot.

```{R}
boxplot(quakes$depth)
```

*The minimum is the bottom line and the maximum is the top line. The median is the bolded black line in the middle.*

### 5.2 (2 pt) 
##### Create a histogram of `depth` using the `hist()` function. What important information does the histogram provide that the boxplot does not?

```{R}
hist(quakes$depth)
```

*The histogram shows us the ranges of values that are most prevalent. This is now shown in a histogram.*

### 5.3 (2 pt) 
##### Create a scatterplot by plotting variables `mag` and `stations` against each other using the `plot()` function. Note that to generate a scatterplot, the `plot()` takes two arguments: the x-axis variable and the y-axis variable. Describe the relationship between the two variables.

```{R}
plot(quakes$stations, quakes$mag)
```

*There is a linear relationship between stations and magnitude.*

### 5.4 (3 pt) 
##### Create scatterplot of the quakes' geographic locations by plotting `long` on the x-axis and `lat` on the y-axis. Using this plot, and the map/link below (note the two trenches), and some of the techniques you practiced above, are deeper quakes more likely to originate east or west of Fiji?

```{R fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(quakes$long, quakes$lat)
plot(quakes$depth, quakes$lat)
```

*Deeper quakes are more likely to originate east of Fiji.*
